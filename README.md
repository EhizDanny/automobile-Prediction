# Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the prices of cars using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and engine size, the model will provide accurate price estimates for different types of vehicles.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information on various cars, including their make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and price. The data was collected from online car listings and cleaned for analysis.

## Model

The machine learning model used for this project is a regression model that predicts the price of cars based on the input features. The model was trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook `car_price_prediction.ipynb` to train the model and make price predictions for cars.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, indicating its ability to predict car prices effectively. Further analysis and optimization can be done to improve the model's performance and provide more accurate price estimates.
